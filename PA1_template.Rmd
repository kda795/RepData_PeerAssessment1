This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

Loading and preprocessing the data
```{r}
library(curl)
# Please set your own working directory
fileName<-"repdata_data_activity.zip"
if (! file.exists(fileName)) {
  fileUrl<-"http://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/repdata%2Fdata%2Factivity.zip"
  download.file(fileUrl, fileName, quiet = TRUE, mode = "wb")
  unzip(fileName)
}
activity<-read.csv("activity.csv",sep=",",header=TRUE)


#What is mean total number of steps taken per day?
# Get list of days from pattern
List_of_days<-unique(activity$date)
#List sum stepts of every days
steps_of_day<-c()
#List of mean step of every day
mean_steps_of_day<-c()
#List of median step of every day

for (day in List_of_days) {
   #Calculate sum, mean and median of every day

# Make a histogram of the total number of steps taken each day
hist(steps_of_day$steps,xlab="steps",main="Steps of days")
```
Print mean steps of the day
```{r}
print(mean_steps_of_day)
```
Print median steps of the day
```{r}
print(median_steps_of_day)
```

```{r}
#What is the average daily activity pattern?
List_of_5min_intervals<-unique(activity$interval)
steps_of_5min_intervals<-c()
for (int in List_of_5min_intervals) {
  steps_of_5min_intervals<-c(steps_of_5min_intervals,mean(activity  $steps[activity$interval == int],na.rm=TRUE))
}
steps_of_5min_intervals<-data.frame(interval=List_of_5min_intervals,mean_steps=steps_of_5min_intervals)


#Make a time series plot (i.e. type = "l") of the 5-minute interval (x-axis) and the average number of steps taken, averaged across all days (y-axis)
plot(steps_of_5min_intervals$interval,steps_of_5min_intervals$mean_steps,type='l',xlab="Minute Interval",ylab="Mean steps",main="Minute interval of the day")
```

Interval 835 contains maximum number of steps
```{r}
# Which 5-minute interval, on average across all the days in the dataset, contains the maximum number of steps?
steps_of_5min_intervals[steps_of_5min_intervals$mean_steps == max(steps_of_5min_intervals$mean_steps,na.rm=TRUE),]

```

There is 2304 missing value in dataset
```{r}
#Calculate and report the total number of missing values in the dataset (i.e. the total number of rows with NAs)
table(is.na(activity$steps))
```

```{r}
#Create a new dataset that is equal to the original dataset but with the missing data filled in.
activity_fillin_NA<-activity
mean_stets<-round(mean(activity$steps,na.rm=TRUE))
for (i in 1:nrow(activity_fillin_NA)) {
  if (is.na(activity_fillin_NA$steps[i]))
    #Devise a strategy for filling in all of the missing values in the dataset. 
    activity_fillin_NA$steps[i]<-abs(round(rnorm(1,mean_stets,mean_stets),0))

#Make a histogram of the total number of steps taken each day and Calculate and report the mean and median total number of steps taken per day.
```
Histogram of day with fill in 
```{r}
hist(steps_of_day_fillin_NA$steps,xlab="steps",main="Steps of days with NA fill in")
```
Print mean steps of the day with fill in
```{r}
print(mean_steps_of_day_fillin_NA)
```
Print median steps of the day with fill in
```{r}
print(median_steps_of_day_fillin_NA)
```

Weekdays - 0, Weekends - 1, 
You should to change "суббота" and "воскресенье" to "saturday" and "sunday", because I had russian locale on my PC
```{r}
days<-c()
for (i in 1:length(activity$date)) {
   
   if ((weekdays(as.Date(activity$date[i])) == "суббота") | (weekdays(as.Date(activity$date[i])) == "воскресенье"))
    days<-c(days,1)
  else days<-c(days,0)
}

activity<-data.frame(activity, days=days)
activity_weekdays<-subset(activity,activity$days == 0)
activity_weekends<-subset(activity,activity$days == 1)
steps_of_5min_intervals_weekdays<-c()
steps_of_5min_intervals_weekends<-c()
for (int in List_of_5min_intervals) {
  steps_of_5min_intervals_weekdays<-c(steps_of_5min_intervals_weekdays,mean(activity$steps[activity$interval == int & activity$days == 0 ],na.rm=TRUE))
  steps_of_5min_intervals_weekends<-c(steps_of_5min_intervals_weekends,mean(activity$steps[activity$interval == int & activity$days == 1 ],na.rm=TRUE))
}
```
Yes, weekdays and weekends are different, probably because at the weekends man(women) has more time to walk :)
```{r}
par(mfrow=c(2,1))
plot(List_of_5min_intervals,steps_of_5min_intervals_weekdays,type='l',col="red", main ='Weekdays',xlab = "5 minute interval",ylab="Number of steps")
plot(List_of_5min_intervals,steps_of_5min_intervals_weekends,type='l',col="blue", main ='Weekends', xlab = "5 minute interval",ylab="Number of steps")
```
